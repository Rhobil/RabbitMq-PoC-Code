# RabbitMq-PoC-Code
Just proof of concept code for working with the C# RabbitMq client.

Currently I have some example code of how you can track message delivery status (delivery to the exchangeand queues - not consumer), while doing bulk publishing. See my related blog post: http://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2017/3/11/sending-messages-in-bulk-and-tracking-delivery-status-rabbitmq-publishing-part-2
